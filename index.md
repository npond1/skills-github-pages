# The Taconic Revelation

_In hands of flesh and hearts of fire,_  
_A humble shell, the soul’s attire,_  
_A folded truth in toasted skin—_  
_The universe wrapped up within._

**Behold, the taco, fleeting grace,**  
**A paradox we all embrace:**  
**Both chaos strewn and order found,**  
**Where meat and meaning both are bound.**

_The shell—soft corn or hardened wheat—_  
_Is time itself, concise, complete._  
_It cradles moments, breaks with bite,_  
_Like hours lost to appetite._

_The meat—our passions, dark and deep,_  
_The dreams we chase, the thoughts we keep._  
_Spiced like longing, grilled with sin,_  
_Each flavor echoes what's within._

_Lettuce lies like fleeting youth,_  
_Crisp with color, veiling truth._  
_Cheese, the comforts we desire,_  
_Melting fast, like love or fire._

_Tomatoes burst with joys we knew,_  
_Brief and red, like wounds we grew._  
_And salsa—ah, the sacred pain—_  
_The tears we cherish in the rain._

**But lo! The eater and the eaten—**  
**In that moment, ego’s beaten.**  
**A silent prayer, a bite, a pause,**  
**The cosmos yields to mortal jaws.**

_We seek enlightenment in scrolls,_  
_In stars, in sermons, distant goals._  
_Yet find nirvana in the street—_  
_In tacos warm, in tastes complete._

**So let philosophers debate**  
**The nature of eternal fate.**  
**I’ll chew the mystery, let it be:**  
**The taco is the self, and me.**
